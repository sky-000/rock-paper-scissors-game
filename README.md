✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors – JavaScript Project
This is a fun and simple Rock Paper Scissors game that I built after learning JavaScript from Apna College’s YouTube course. It’s a small project that helped me understand how to use JavaScript to add logic and interactivity to a webpage.

🛠️ Built with:

HTML – for structure

CSS – for styling

JavaScript – for game logic and interactivity

🎮 How it works:
You play against the computer. Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly picks one too. The winner is decided based on the classic game rules!

💡 This was one of my first JavaScript projects, and it helped me practice using functions, conditionals, and event handling.
